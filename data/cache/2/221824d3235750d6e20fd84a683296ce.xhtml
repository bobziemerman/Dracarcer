Genevieve swung her heavy axe sidelong toward the monster grasping at her throat, slicing clean through one of the tough, thorny vines running up and down its body that gave the previously inert skeleton the strength necessary to stand upright and pursue its target. Well, the vines, and a substantial infusion of necrotic energy. Despite it being mid-day, it was dark in the thick forest, and it was hard to see exactly how much damage her strike had been able to do. The low, dense, claustrophobic branches of the redwood&#039;s trees let little daylight through to the forest floor, and it was sometimes accompanied by slow drips of the sticky, blood-red sap that sweated from the bark of the trees. And the fact that the undead in this forest were reinforced with plants giving them natural camouflage made matters all the worse. But when she heard bones rattling, Genevieve knew her task wasn&#039;t finished.

<p>
The creature raised its arms toward her again and she spun around to its side, using her momentum to help lift her axe high and bring it down on the creature&#039;s back. With gravity&#039;s help this time, she heard the unmistakable crunch of bones splintering apart and bore down even harder on her swing. She drove the monster to the ground under her weapon and managed to cleave all the way through its torso, burying her axe in the soft, loamy earth beneath.

The half of the skeleton that remained animated continued to slowly pull itself along the ground toward her, but as long as Genevieve kept an eye on it and maintained her distance, she could take a moment to catch her breath. She had fought undead before, of course; most people her age who grew up in this region did eventually. But this was her first time out in the weald, alone, and the things out here were… different. Scarier. Going beyond the protective walls of Fallwinter, and even then, off of the roads, is not something many would choose to do voluntarily. But it was the task she was given by the bloodhunters: an order of death-dealers who took on the dangerous monsters that threatened the region&#039;s settlements and kept their people safe. When things in the redweald went bump in the night, the bloodhunters were the ones who bumped back. They were an elusive and mysterious order, and not always trusted by those they protected; but when Genevieve had run into one and managed to convince them to let her go through an initiation trial, she jumped at the chance. Even <em>after</em> it turned out to be wandering into the woods alone to slay one of the redweald&#039;s “reinforced” undead. Simply wounding this one wouldn&#039;t be enough for the trial; she&#039;d have to kill it, once and for all, and bring back the gem buried in its ribcage as proof.

<p>
The torso&#039;s vine-muscles contracted and released, pulling it toward her as she backed away, careful to stay well out of its reach. When it had gotten far enough away from where its legs had been severed, Genevieve circled back and retrieved her axe, raising it steady overhead for one final blow. As the skeleton slowly clawed its way into range, she brought the axe down onto its head with a loud CRACK, shattering it like pottery into dozens of small shards. When she was sure it wasn&#039;t going to move anymore, she bent down and carefully slipped a hand between its thorny ribs, ripping the pulsating black gem free from where the creature&#039;s heart used to be, who knows how long ago.

Genevieve smiled as she looked down at the hard-fought prize in her palm. She had done it. She was finally going to be a bloodhunter, and hopefully rid this awful place of its dangers for good. Some of them, anyway. But she was startled out of her cheery daze by the sounds of growling coming from somewhere else nearby. Not the growls of an animal (living things never stayed living for long in these woods); more like a low moan from someone who had let an angry rat claw its way out of their throat years ago. Genevieve knew all too well what that sound meant: zombies.
</p>

<p>
They must have heard the skull shatter and come looking for signs of life. There were noises coming from all directions; probably at least three zombies, but Genevieve couldn&#039;t pinpoint exactly where. She raised her axe into an aggressive stance and backed up against a large, nearby tree. Whatever was coming, it wasn&#039;t going to sneak up behind her.
</p>

<p>
The panic triggered something in her mind, and Genevieve suddenly had a jolt of inspiration: when her mother had still been alive, she had tried to prepare Genevieve for a life in the weald by teaching her a prayer that would help her see monsters. She was never able to get it to work as a little girl, but she found that she still remembered the words, and frankly it was the only idea she had at the moment. She closed her eyes like her mother had said to, and began rattling off the incantation as fast as she could, hoping for a miracle. If it worked, supposedly undead and the like would glow in your vision, preventing them from hiding in the shadows. When she reached the end of the prayer, Genevieve couldn&#039;t quite bring herself to open her eyes back up to the dark forest around her. She said one more short prayer to her mother for help, and then pried her eyes open, hoping to see even a flicker of some shape off in the distance.
</p>

<p>
The lights that filled her vision nearly blinded her, and she unconsciously dropped her axe as she covered her eyes. After a moment, she gingerly lowered her arm and blinked a few times, adjusting to the sight. Every tree in the forest was glowing bright green. She could see their roots spreading beneath the ground, twisting around and along each other&#039;s, reaching down far deeper than the trees were tall; so deep she eventually couldn&#039;t see the glow anymore. The forest was an army of lights, and she could swear the branches around her were getting closer and brighter with each passing second. As she started to bend down to pick her axe back up, she felt something firm around her waist. The growls were still some distance away, and when she reached a hand down, she found that whatever had her was… sticky. And cold. And rough. The branches of the tree behind Genevieve tightened around her, lifted her off the ground, and pulled her harder and harder toward its trunk. The more she struggled, the more the sticky sap got on her and held her in place. A few moments later, the nearby zombies once again heard the unmistakable crunch of bones splintering apart.
