The plains of Kharsh sit on the eastern shores of Ordan, and are not so much a country as a loose association of Orcish tribes. The dry, barren wastes that cover the territory&#039;s huge swaths of land are often the sites of bloody and brutal battles of conquest and dominance regularly fought between warring tribes. In Kharsh, combat is king, and if you can&#039;t prove your mettle, you can&#039;t prove your worth.
