The ocean waves hide many things from land-dwellers, including most of the races and dwellings of the Neeruain Benefact. These regions lie scattered about the ocean floor, just off the southern coast of Qurea, and are little known to those beyond the magical kingdom&#039;s boundaries. To those few who know of its existence, it is often seen as loose alliance of peoples and creatures rather than a fully recognized state; although Qurea often treats their common dealings as if it were.

In actuality, the Neeruain Benefact is a voluntary organization that seeks to bring peace to and provide services for its diverse group of constituents; for a price, of course. The leaders of the Benefact are chosen by lottery from amongst any constituents who wish to represent their people. As such, Neeru&#039;s motivations and responses to situations are often hard to predict, and the political climate can shift just as easily as the tides.
