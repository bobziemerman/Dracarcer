<p>
Centuries ago, the hilly, sun-kissed forests now known to the mortals as the Feyboughs was adorably considered the most powerful bastion of magic on the material plane. The polity of Qurea was a sprawling paragon of the mortal&#039;s wildest fantasies of prosperity and opulence; Qurea&#039;s citizens wanted for nothing, and their greatest concerns were of social games and the dramas of political posturing. They believed themselves invincible; and that was the weakness that left them exposed. 
</p>

<p>
When “the Great Cataclysm” swept the material plane and brought all of mortal civilization to its knees, the Fey Courts seized their opportunity to strike. For far too long, mortals had bound our kind and intruded upon our Wilds, exerting their will upon the fair Feyfolk. So in the moment of Qurea&#039;s most desperate weakness, the faint and inscrutable tethers that have always bound the Feywilds to their land&#039;s forests poured out with the full fury of the Fey. Soft, coddled Qurea buckled and collapsed under the pressure, wholly unprepared for their first real fight in millenia.
</p>

<p>
But the Courts have little interest in holding territory on the material plane (given that it&#039;s inferior in every way to our own native Feywilds). They simply wanted to be free to do as they wished, coming and going about the Wilds and the forests alike as is their birthright. So the day they were satisfied that the mortals&#039; little kingdom had been ruined beyond return, they left as unexpectedly as they came, taking their armies with them. But not all the forces of the Wilds that attacked with the Courts were still bound to them; and a number of lesser Fey saw an opportunity to muster their own forces while the Courts were away, and stayed behind.

Once the Courts&#039; armies left, the mortals did their best to “reorder the chaos” in their lands. They built  shallow imitations of their illustrious cities of old; but without the network of portals they had come to rely upon for their travel, the remnants of their nation found itself fractured and disconnected. The footpaths between their cities had long been abandoned, even before the Fey reclaimed what was theirs, and the mortals were loathe to wade into unknown woods so recently treacherous without very good reason. And to be fair, plenty of Feyfolk still frolic about those woods today, eagerly waiting for the next fool to stumble into their domain…
</p>

<p>
Magic was the lifeblood of their old empire, and the region is lousy with the stuff to this day (no doubt thanks to its close ties to the Fey). Artifacts of the old kingdom are commonplace (though many are no longer understood), and there are still a number of arcane wonders to be found here that are the envy of the other mortal lands. But wild magics and happenings inexplicable to the mortal mind abound as well; and the mortals rarely know whether a given bit of magic will come to be a boon or a burden.
</p>

<p>
Many mortals are wary of the Feyboughs, but their kind are short-lived, and in the time since the war many of their generations have passed. The trepidation of their elders has begun to give way to the curiosity of youth, and some of them now yearn to explore the ruins of a fallen kingdom, tempted to the woods by stories of magics and riches left behind in the chaos. The rewards are there to be found, that much is true; but so too are the Fey who would delight in teaching a fresh generation of mortals their place in the world…
