[Hroknar, shaper of blessed stone, we take refuge in You. Guide of all people, God of all deities, Lord of all angels, We pray you to dispel the darkness of corruption from the hearts of nations, And lift their lives by your all-sufficient power.]</em>

The Istovian Empire was one of the longest lasting organizations in history, spanning at least eight thousand years, by some accounts. It is the source of most of the oldest known records of any kind, and many of the mountains&#039; inhabitants still observe some of the ancient traditions prescribed in those texts. The people of those mountains built an indomitable and peerless Empire which outlasted all others for one simple reason: they had to. The harsh and unforgiving climate of their homeland left them no other choice; only the strongest survived, and Istovian society grew to reflect that ideal. A need to adapt in the face of adversity, coupled with the early discovery of valthril, led to several technological revolutions that left the rest of the world well behind. In its final days, Istovia seemed poised to reclaim the total domination over the continent that it once briefly held (and by all accounts deserved). But power brings with it volatility; and in its dedication to greatness, Istovia gathered enough power to tear itself apart.

From its early days, the Istovians savior was Hroknar. He made himself known to His Chosen People before any of the other false gods worshipped on the rest of the continent were ever dreamed up. He is the god of the three greatest threats in the Istovian mountains, which would also come to be the nation&#039;s three most important resources. He is the god of Blood, of Ice, and of Stone; and His Church was the cornerstone upon which the Istovian Empire rested. The nation&#039;s emperors ruled throughout the millenia with varying degrees of autonomy, but the Archprelates of the Church were always close at hand, ready to give voice to Hroknar&#039;s Will for His People. 
</p>

<p>
The greatest of Hroknar&#039;s gifts was the rare element valthril, which can only be found deep within the Istovian mountains; a sign of the nation&#039;s providence. Its first known uses were in warding off and ferreting out dark magic users, as the mineral has magic-resistant properties. But in time, the Istovians soon discovered its applications in creating mechanical marvels that were impossible for the rest of the world, ushering in a new era of technological revolution.

With the rapid progress brought on by daily innovations founded on the blessed element, Istovian society grew beneath the surface of the mountains into an unparalleled network of thriving strongholds. Connected by thunder rails below and speaking towers above, Istovian information and culture travelled at a breakneck pace. Within only a few short generations, the Istovians outgrew their mountain home and sought to bring their knowledge, and Hroknar&#039;s light, to others beyond the mountains. A steady stream of machine armies built in the great Warforge marched to the foot of the hills until they had swelled into a crescendo of Istovian might. The decades-long military campaign that followed saw them claim the farthest reaches of the continent; but the sweet victory was short-lived, as a peasant revolution less than a hundred years later pushed the Istovians back to the mountains from whence they came. And despite constant efforts throughout the rest of its history, the Empire was never again able to ascend to the heights of such greatness.

When the Cataclysm struck, insidious rumors began to whisper through the country that Hroknar was not the divine, benevolent God the Istovians knew him to be. Heretics (many of Qurean origin) claimed to hold proof that he was instead a god of trickery and lies, and poisoned the realm with seeds of doubt. The truth always prevails in the end, but in the face of the grave destruction the world was already facing in those days… the lies were enough. Istovia broke into civil war, and many of the blasphemers were chased out to the unforgiving surface to die; though not before doing considerable damage to the country&#039;s infrastructure, and destroying its capital city. In Istovia&#039;s darkest, final moments, the Church of Hroknar, ever the source of the nation&#039;s strength, picked up the pieces of the fallen Empire, formally dethroning the unbroken line of Istovian emperors, and assuming control of what remained of the mountain&#039;s cities.

After the Cataclysm ended, a holy crusade was set in motion to rid the mountain&#039;s surface of the blasphemers, and avenge the emperors; but with the Dragonsurge, a new generation of monsters had infested the land. The feral white dragons joined the savage goliaths and brutish frost giants in attack anything they saw, making ventures to the surface exceptionally dangerous. But the crystal dragons chose to take in the heretics, and protected their new hoard with ferocity, rendering the holy war a hopeless dream. Skirmishes still take place at the borders, and those who commit illegal acts of magic within the Church&#039;s walls are exiled to the wastes, as is tradition; but the Istovian Empire is likely never to be whole again.
