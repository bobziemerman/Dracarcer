Despite it being mid-day, it was dark in the thick forest, and it was hard to see exactly how much damage her strike had been able to do. The low, dense, claustrophobic branches of the redwood's trees let little daylight through to the forest floor, and it was sometimes accompanied by slow drips of the sticky, blood-red sap that sweated from the bark of the trees. And the fact that the undead in this forest were reinforced with plants giving them natural camouflage made matters all the worse.

The forest was an army of lights, and she could swear the branches around her were getting closer and brighter with each passing second.
