<p>
By far the most magical of the realms of Aidilon, the Qurean Polity shines as a beacon of prosperity, opportunity, and leisure to the other regions of the land. But look beneath the country&#039;s illusory exterior, and you will often find sinister forces plotting all manner of misdeeds upon their own neighbors…
</p>

<p>
The Game, as it is often called by Qurea&#039;s citizens, is played by most members of Qurean society (ruthlessly, in many cases), and is oft described as an ever-present quest to rise through the ranks of the nation&#039;s social and political hierarchy. The government, and subsequently the citizenry, of Qurea is divided into seven Orders, with each Order&#039;s members referred to as &#039;Citizens of the Xth Order&#039;; or, more commonly, &#039;Mages of the Xth Order&#039;, as the top 5 tiers are comprised almost exclusively of the Gifted. There are 7 Citizens of the First Order, 77 of the Second, 777 of the Third, etc. until the Seventh Order, which encompasses all remaining citizens. 
</p>

<p>
Each Qurean is granted entry into the Seventh Order upon birth or citizenship, and each member of an Order votes annually to elect the members of the Order above. Members of any Order may also issue edicts, which must be treated as law unless overruled by someone of a higher Order, or contested by someone of the same Order, at which point the contested edict is handed up to the next highest Order for resolution. The only exception to these rules is Qurea&#039;s national guard, known simply as &#039;Citizens of Order&#039;; to whom edicts may not be applied while they are on duty. They are instead required to follow an internal code, and are responsible for self-policing.
</p>

<p>
Qurea&#039;s seven First Order mages are known as the Magistrati, who both reside and do most of their governmental business in the capital city&#039;s sprawling coastal palace, called the Magisterium. Traditionally, each Magister is often a representative of one of the current most prevalent types of spellcaster; though that has not always been true throughout history. There are many among the Giftless segment of the population who advocate for better representation of non-magical individuals in the higher levels of Qurean government; and there are a few who aggressively act on their malcontent.
</p>

<p>
However, as a country populated almost exclusively by magical beings, Qurea and its major cities are prone to certain magical quirks. For example, the country is almost exclusively vegetarian, and prefers healthier dishes that have simply been magically flavored to taste exquisite. Much of the landscape, particularly the layout of the the capital city of Archerald, is also prone to shifting; as is bound to happen when those who can physically move mountains have little else better to do.

<p>
“As you pass through the intricately carved and masterful stonework housing the Portcullis, you see a sprawling city built with no less craftsmanship. To the right, an ornate and delicate-looking wrought-iron fence runs off the of gate, along the city’s edge, and into the forest, which appears to have crawled over the man-made boundary and extended itself well into the city proper. Houses and shops sit serenely amongst the trees as shafts of light meander through the leaves overhead. Outside the city-forest and rolling over Archerald’s gentle hills are a swirling mixture of meandering streets, colorful shops, and well-decorated houses; some ornate, and some with a more subdued, but no less elegant grace. Running along the eastern edge of the city, bordering the sea, stands a seemingly endless row of the most opulent and magnificent palace structures you’ve ever seen. The palace row curves with the edge of the coast, and from your vantage point at the gate, you can see it continue on for a good mile before it bends out of sight and over the hills. The palace seems to be all one enormous structure, but at one point, it changes theme suddenly, as if the builders got tired of that particular aesthetic and decided to do something else entirely. Off in the distance, an enormous dark stone building toward the center of the city rises high into the sky, as scattered hippogriffs fly past it overhead. The great beasts seem to be ferrying people all over the city; and a large, roofless stable sits nearby, where more of the creatures and their owner wait to carry new passengers across the dream-like capitol.” 
</p>

<p>
Qurea&#039;s capital city of Archerald is truly a splendor to behold. Its coastal palace, the Magisterium, is the largest of its kind in the known world, and acts as the country&#039;s primary hub for government and political dealings. At the city&#039;s center is the Crown of the Gods, a collection of temples to the various deities worshiped by Qurea&#039;s citizenry. Beneath the Crown lies the city&#039;s primary prison, pervaded by an anti-magic field. 
</p>

<p>
Teleportation is prohibited within the city, to deter sudden and unwanted &#039;guests&#039;; but the city&#039;s Western Portal houses magic circles to many of Qurea&#039;s other large cities, as well as countries further beyond. For this reason, hippogriffs are a common mode of transportation throughout the city, and are readily available should the need for travel arise.

<p>
The beach town of Sebassa exists as much above the ocean&#039;s waves as below, and it is home to many of Qurea&#039;s more aquatic residents. Merfolk, selkies, aquatic elves, druids, and various water elementalists can all be found here; either on Sebassa&#039;s collection of beach-moored floating barges, or on the connected chain of housing structures that sink off deep into the ocean beyond.

<div class="level4">

<p>
Little is known about the reclusive colony of gnomes that live in the forests to the northwest of Archerald. Some say they&#039;re in exile from their former home in Istovia, punished for muddying their clockworks with the Gift. Others think they hide themselves away to protect some closely guarded secret; one that could revolutionize the world as we know it. Whatever the case, they mostly keep to themselves, and so Archerald and its inhabitants have had little cause to bother them; which seems to be just how the gnomes like things.

Ostium is the northern and western-most city in Qurea, and as such is the primary point of trade with the adjacent nations of Uthoukar and Evedale. It is also often traveled through by both visitors to the country and travelling Qurean diplomats; as it houses one of the magic circles tied to Archerald&#039;s Western Portal.
