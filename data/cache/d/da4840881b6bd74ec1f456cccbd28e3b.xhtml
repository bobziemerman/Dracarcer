In the swampland to the southwest of Evedale lie the marshes and jungles of the Anschluss. In the eighth age, the region&#039;s fledgling Lizardfolk tribes organized into a confederation of the same name, and declared their independence from their slavers in Evedale. After a long, bitter war, Evedale conceded the territory to the south to the fledgling alliance of tribes, and the Anschluss gained sovereignty over their native homeland. They remain largely inactive in Aidilon politics beyond their immediate domain, preferring to keep to themselves and their kin; and to this day are wary and untrusting of outsiders.

<p>
The Lizardfolk race is originally from this region, and its members can almost always trace their personal ancestry back to before the Anschluss; if they can’t, they are usually considered an outcast by the rest of their people. As the first sentient species to emerge from the swamps that were mostly ignored by the other races of Aidilon, the Lizardfolk of Anschluss consider themselves to be the rightful inhabitants of the territory. Unfortunately, each individual tribe considers themselves to be the true, rightful heirs; but they all recognize that non-Lizardfolk usurpers are the larger, primary threat, and must be dealt with above all else.
</p>

<p>
The Lizardfolk were almost willing to reconsider this position many generations ago, when various groups of Dragonborn arrived to help them fight off their oppressors from Evedale. But unfortunately, they were betrayed when some of the Dragonborn subsequently laid claim to their lands after the war; uninvited, and unwelcome. In more recent generations, other races like the Grung and the Tabaxi have emerged and also tried to take up residence in the Lizardfolk’s ancestral homeland, but the Lizardfolk have ensured that they met with limited success.

<p>
When news of the Lizardfolk uprising in Evedale spread across Aidilon in the Eighth Age, a number of Dragonborn from across the continent felt called to aid their reptilian cousins in the rebellion against their enslavement. After the long-fought war, many of these Dragonborn (primarily those of black, bronze, green, and gold lineages) decided to stay in the now-familiar swamps and forests of the newly coined Anschluss territory. 
</p>

<p>
However, when the Dragonborn’s help was no longer immediately needed, the Lizardfolk became cruel, and turned on their former allies, suggesting (and eventually threatening) that they leave. But the Dragonborn had now established ties and homes here, and felt that they had earned their right to stay. The Lizardfolk tribes&#039; hostility only made most of the Dragonborn that decided to stay dig in deeper, and the Anschluss Dragonborn soon found themselves entrenched in the same tribal warfare that had embroiled Lizardfolk society for generations.

<h3 class="sectionedit5" id="grung">Grung</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The Grung are an aggressive, froglike humanoid race that is fiercely territorial; they see themselves as superior to most other creatures, regardless of whether that’s true or not. All Grungs naturally secrete a substance that is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures, which they sometimes use to poison their weapons. Being amphibious, Grungs require water to live; any Grung that fails to immerse itself in water for at least an hour during a day becomes quite exhausted.
</p>

<p>
Grungs are always on the lookout for people and animals they can capture and enslave, using them for all manner of menial tasks. Mostly, though, they just like bossing other creatures around. Slaves are fed mildly poisoned food to keep them lethargic and compliant, and a creature afflicted in this way over a long period of time becomes a shell of its former self that can be restored to normalcy only by magic. 
</p>

<p>
Grung society is built upon a strict caste system based on skin color: each caste lays eggs in a separate hatching pool, and juvenile Grungs join their caste upon emergence from the hatchery. All Grungs are a dull, greenish gray when they are born, but each individual takes on the color of its caste as it grows to adulthood. From highest to lowest caste, Grungs can be:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Gold: Ruler, highest leadership</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Orange: Elite warriors</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Red: Scholars and magic users</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Purple: Supervisors, administrators, commanders, and guides</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Blue: Artisans and other domestic roles</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Green: Warriors, hunters, and laborers</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A Grung normally remains in its caste for life. On rare occasions, an individual that distinguishes itself with great deeds can earn an invitation to join a higher caste. Through a combination of herbal tonics and ritual magic, an elevated Grung changes color and is inducted into its new caste in the same way that a juvenile of the caste would be. From then on, the Grung and any of its future progeny are members of the higher caste.

<h3 class="sectionedit6" id="tabaxi">Tabaxi</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The Tabaxi are a reclusive, cat-like race, and wiser than their reptilian and amphibious neighbors: they knew better than to get involved in a never-ending territory war with the others. Instead, they keep to small, nomadic family units that trade and engage amicably with one another whenever they meet, and otherwise keep to the treetops, caves, and shadows whenever possible, trying their best not to be seen.
