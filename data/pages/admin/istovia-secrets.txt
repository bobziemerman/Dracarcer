===== Notes =====

  * Highly militaristic (almost always at war)
  * Technically a monarchy, functionally a theocracy
  * There is a strong resistance presence
  * People are generally treated well, and are actually quite content with their authoritarian rulers
  * Super harsh climate
  * Uses radios and landline telephones to communicate across the empire
  * Many buildings (like Valspart) are lined with valthril, which prevents teleportation through walls
    * Most of the empire also lives underground, making teleporting to cities or the veins dangerous
    * All buildings are also lined with metal, to protect from burrowing predators like Rhemoraz
  * Most guards are Paladins of Hroknar
  * National colors
    * Red: blood; commonly represents church of Hroknar
    * White: ice; commonly represents purity from magic
    * Silver: stone/valthril; commonly represents Istovia
  * Resistance colors: 
    * Blue: anti-Hroknar
    * Black: pro-magic
    * Gold: anti-Istovia/empiricism/war
  * Church of Hroknar notes
    * Semi-compulsory prayer is every day at sunrise/sunset, everywhere in istovia, facing toward valspart
    * Church symbol: lower triangle represents a mountain peak, upper is an icicle, diamond is bloodstone
    * Heald
      * Zjelka (blood, no valthril), manages the day to day of the church, based out of brun/valspart
      * Morthane (ice, 25% valthril) lives in the vault of heresies, rarely leaves
      * Tohk (stone, all 4 limbs/some face valthril) is on the surface, 'evangelizing' (guiding the war and maintaining the empire)
      * It is encouraged to wear something red at all times in show of the common brotherhood. Also sometimes white and silver in defiance of magic and support of the empire, respectively
      * Some plants and animals are corrupted by magic and should be eradicated. All other animals are born of stone and blood and are kin with humanoids, and to be treated with equal respect. Plants don’t bleed, and thus are lesser beings
      * The Holy Writ is only ever in Dwarvish, and chronicles the revelation (first appearance) of Hroknar, several other historical events of note (mostly wars), and examples of well-lived lives (truth, justice, and generosity)
  * Valspart layout and defenses
