====== Maha'ai ======


Before recorded history, there was a group of mages known as the Maha'ai, consisting of some of the greatest Wordsmiths in the world. They each dedicated such focus to studying a specific facet of magic, that, as they grew in power over the subsequent millennia, they came to physically embody their chosen field of study. Over time, they became immortal and modified their material forms as they saw fit, becoming unrecognizable as the beings they once were. 

Eventually, they grew to such power that the five great mortal races allied together in self-preservation to banish them through the southern gates, ridding the world of many of its most powerful, near elemental forces. However, some were either too powerful or not powerful enough to be pulled by the region's call, and remain on Aidilon today. But even from the planes beyond, the Maha'ai soon learned to reach back across the great divide, and began influencing their former homeland in the hopes of reclaiming it when the mortals' magic ran out, and they could return to conquer Aidilon once again.

All Maha'ai are ultimately self interested, and therefore evil; some of the most powerful are listed below:
