===== Notes =====

  * Most guards are Wizards
  * Fanciers send messages via Tressym (flying cat)
  * Qurea was the original birthplace of the elves, and many modern words and locations can be traced back to them
  * People rarely use mounts since you can freely teleport anywhere and rent hippogriffs in most large cities, but when they do, they use Elk
  * The deities worshiped in qurea are the closest remaining representations to some of the original Maha'ai. Other deities that contact this plane are Maha'ai, but go by new names created by their followers, since they forgot their own


==== People of note ====

  * Each magister has a secret:
    * Dynsbeck: Avatar of Na’issa; Dynsbeck is the body she currently chooses to inhabit (and Dynsbeck... doesn't love it.)
    * Kharga: the true queen of kharsh, plotting to attack qurea with orcs again
    * Talven: the former chalice
    * Magister: bound his ancestor, a pit fiend (devil) named Dror'goth to his will
    * Ahd’m: secretly an ancient copper dragon
    * Tavia: knows the secret of the maha’ai; is funding monitum because she knows what's coming
    * Ilithra: is an archfey (lv20 bard, plus spring eladrin features, incl damage resistances)
  * Magister god mode abilities:
    * Dynsbecc: Na'issa avatar state
    * Talven: wish spells don’t fail
    * Ah’dm: dragon form
    * Tavia: call aid from all gods at once
    * Kharga: Khorzh rage/avatar state
    * Magister: summon devil army
    * Ilithra: summon fey army
  * Alistair Fidelian
    * Had his son killed in an apparent demon attack to garner sympathy to make it to 4th order
    * Tries to keep tabs on Azura, mostly to play on her death as well
  * The gnomes of Arcgis were banished from Istovia, but took a large volume of Valthril with them and have been experimenting with more advanced forms of circuitry. At one point, they made a Grievous error and made an AI that became sentient and declared itself General, bent on wiping out the scourge that is magic. Many spellcasters in Arcgis were killed and General Grievous marched on Archerald, but was quickly put down by the J'dai order of monks in the surrounding forest
  * Xilora Greymantle is attempting to build an army of superpowerful persons/constructs so that she can destroy the church of Hroknar and remove the persecution in Istovia
  * Ariadne Dusta was resurrected, and is technically an undead
  * Azura Fidelian was killed in a campaign, but was brought back as a warlock/bard as a part of a pact with The Lich Queen Vlaakith, and now captains a submarine-ish Bachelor's delight (now called the Widower's Sorrow) off the coast of Hartland
  * Higher-ups in the anarchist group are 2-3 order warlocks of Nydos, the god of chaos, and receive power and artifacts from him for sewing chaos (they often unknowingly work with He, the Magister)
      * Dropped the magisterium into the sea because they had bought all the property that would be on the new coast, and the magisters would have to pay them a fortune to rebuild the palace
  * The illusionist Dayvah Malai isn't dead, and lives in her house


==== Places of note ====

  * When navigating the forest between Ostium and Archerald, turn left through four forks (this changes if security becomes a problem)
  * about 20% of Lucis' inhabitants are Fey or Fiends, constantly playing tricks on visitors and each other. The city barely sleeps, and most of the populace is active at any given time
  * There are bound places in Saeculum where you can freely pass between the material plane and the Feywild, but they are kept secret by the more powerful Druids (mostly for the safety of all)
  * A former party wiped out a significant portion of the lizardfolk in Rakesk; "no one" knows why
  * The Marbled Palace specializes in breads with mint and cinnamon
  * Feygates
    * Saeculum
    * At the bottom of Monitum's lake
