====== Qurea secret stuff ======

===== People, places, monsters, objects, and events of note =====
  * Qurea was the original birthplace of the elves, and many modern words and locations can be traced back to them
  * 9900+:
    * People rarely use mounts since you can freely teleport anywhere and Griffon in most large cities, but when they do, they use Elk
    * Alistair Fidelian
      * Had his son killed in an apparent demon attack to garner sympathy to make it to 4th order
      * Tries to keep tabs on Azura, mostly to play on her death as well
    * The Wellspring is in Azuroc, in an underground grove hidden by illusions and guarded by undercover guards
    * When navigating the forest between Ostium and Archerald, turn left through four forks (this changes if security becomes a problem)
    * Anne of Magwyn lives somewhere near the mountains to the south, with her Anethyst dragon companion Ozbbmi
    * about 20% of Lucis' inhabitants are Fey, constantly playing tricks on visitors and each other. The city barely sleeps, and most of the populace is active at any given time
    * There are bound places in Saeculum where you can freely pass between the material plane and the Feywild
    * The gnomes of Arcgis were banished from Istovia, but took a large volume of Valthil with them and have been experimenting with more advanced forms of circuitry. At one point, they made a Grievous error and made an AI that became sentient and declared itself General, bent on wiping out the scourge that is magic. Many spellcasters in Arcgis were killed and General Grievous marched on Archerald, but was quickly put down by the J'dai order of monks in the surrounding forest
    * Former party wiped out a significant portion of the lizardfolk in Rakesk; "no one" knows why
    * Wizards in Monitum study the creatures and portals of Wrakarr
    * The deities worshiped in qurea are the closest remaining representations to some of the original Maha'ai. Other deities that contact this plane are Maha'ai, but go by new names created by their followers, since they forgot their own
    * Magister Talven Brightfallow is the most powerful sorcerer on the planet, as he was the Chalice of Fate for thousands of years
    * Xilora Greymantle is attempting to build an army of superpowerful persons/constructs so that she can destroy the church of Hroknar and remove the persecution in Istovia
    * Ariadne Dusta was resurrected, and is technically an undead
    * Higher-ups in the anarchist group are warlocks of Nydos, the god of chaos, and receive power and artifacts from him for sewing chaos
    * Dayvah Malai isn't dead, and lives in her house
