====== Supernatural Forces ======

===== Yfan'si (magic) =====

Magic (yfan'si) comes from one of three sources in Dracarcer:
  * Arcane: Direct manipulation of the Weave (Bards, Wizards)
  * Derived: Internal power derived from or granted by some other source (Sorcerers, Warlocks)
  * Divine: Asking a more powerful entity to cast magic for you (Clerics, Druids, Paladins)

In the third case, all clerics, druids, and paladins are appealing to a Maha'ai. For clerics and paladins, it is the true identity of their chosen deity, and for druids it is Na'eisai.

Direct manipulation of the Weave is done through specific sonic configurations. Bards heavily alter their Ichos (magical impetus; i.e. sound) with Synodeia (things like melody and accompaniment); while wizards alter a more direct form of the true Word (spoken Primordial), and use Cheironomia (somatic gestures) to create resonant pockets to further shape their energy. In many cases, a physical material with the proper resonance is also required to cause the Ichos to have the proper effect on the magical Weave; sometimes destroying the material in the process. In this way, verbal, somatic, and material components combine in many different ways to allow a caster to manipulate energies beyond mortal perception, and influence the world around them.

Some powerful beings are able to effectively use all of these properties of resonance together, and sometimes make use of physiology uncommon to the people of Aidilon; allowing them to create and change frequencies in ways unknown to most practitioners of magic. A creature with this level of understanding of yfan'si can often cast spells that would be incomprehensible to most mages, and would be written off by many as a god with unattainable power.


===== Maha'ai (gods) =====

Before recorded history, there was a group of such mages known as the Maha'ai, consisting of some of the greatest Wordsmiths in the world. They each dedicated such focus to studying a specific facet of magic, that, as they grew in power over the subsequent millennia, they came to physically embody their chosen field of study. Over time, they became immortal and modified their material forms as they saw fit, becoming unrecognizable as the beings they once were. 

Eventually, they grew to such power that the five great races allied together in self-preservation to banish them through the southern gates, ridding the world of many of its most powerful, near elemental forces. However, some were either too powerful or not powerful enough to be pulled by the region's call, and remain on Aidilon today. But even from the planes beyond, the Maha'ai soon learned to reach back across the great divide, and began influencing their former homeland in the hopes of reclaiming it when the mortals' magic ran out, and they could return to conquer Aidilon once again.

All Maha'ai are ultimately self interested, and therefore evil; some of the most powerful are listed below:
