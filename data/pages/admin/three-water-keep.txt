===== Lost history =====

The Three Water bridge fords the point where two tributaries meet the Tidewater river just south of Corwald; the ground is rocky, covered in scrub plants, and the rivers are quite narrow where they meet, running quickly through deep water. In an act of bravery defending the bridge, the Bevver family was granted titles to the property, and given the right to establish tolls to build and maintain a fortress. Their keep expanded from the initial guardhouse, encompassing a large area connected to the east of the bridge, and stood for about a century; but the family grew greedy. They began expanding their ownership of bridges further along the run, buying them, destroying them, and attempting to slowly amass power through control of the Tidewater's crossings.

Eighty years ago, Lord Danrig Bevver, the last lord of Three Water Keep, stopped the royal procession and prevented their crossing on a visit to a neighboring fiefdom. The king, outraged by his behavior, ordered him executed on the spot, and declared that the keep would be torn down, stone by stone. The lands and titles were stripped from Bevver family, and their pledged knights and servants were disbanded.

Fenris Bevver, Danridg's only son - just an adolescent at the time, found his father's head in a patch of baby's breath at the base of the bridge. Vowing revenge, he called out to dark forces, and forged a pact to usurp the throne. He spoke with a devil, who warned, "You will not live to see the throne seated with your bloodline, but so long as your knights are true to your cause, and steadfast as the flowers crowning your father's head, the seat will be yours, in time."

The descendants of those first knights maintain their stations in the "family" when they come of age, taking all kinds of unassuming jobs and working toward the eventual, inevitable uprising. They work as bakers, money-counters, scribes, city watch, and any other supporting jobs and positions in society where they can exercise their influence. The knights are playing a long game, infiltrating the kingdom at every level; and while they generally work for the waste and ruin of the kingdom, it isn't an immediate goal. Perhaps they encourage excessive expense on a large party, and heavy taxes on the poor. Lower level members may build up allies and contacts among the common folk, while the higher level members contribute to the decadence and waste of the ruling class.

The devil's pact requires members of the family to maintain their secrecy in the organization, and to spread waste and dissent within and around the ruling family. Knights may be hereditary, or inducted - but all must swear an oath to work for the family's eventual return to power, at the site of the original bridge, at midnight. Provided that at least one knight lives, a new "Crown" of Fenris' bloodline may be inducted on midnight of their 13th birthday in a ritual at the bridge. There may be more than one inducted family member, but the eldest is "The Crown." Upon death (three failed death saves), the pact devil arrives and harvests the souls of all "Greater Knights" and "Crowns" and vanishes.

The nicknames for Three Water Keep's Men are parts of the area surrounding the Keep: "Cobblestone", "Gate", "Bridge", "Tower", etc., with "The Crown" leading them. The keep and title no longer formally exist, but the original knights vowed to return their holding to its former glory. Each knight carries a magical sprig of baby's breath on their person at all times; this small token not only serves as a bond between them, "The Crown", and the pact, but also provides some magical protections that make it difficult to identify the wearer.

**Should the players use higher level divination spells such as legend lore to discover more about Three Water Keep**: 
"You see the image of a crouching young man, holding the head of his father, lovingly trying to wrap it in a cloth while crying freely. He stands, talking with someone behind him, the sound becomes warped - and the image is ripped from your mind. You cannot remember his face, but you smell sulfur."
