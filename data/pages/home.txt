====== Dracarcer ======

Dracarcer is a fantasy roleplaying setting originally build for D&D, and assumes and is accommodating of most of the basic D&D campaign settings and rules for races, alignments, monsters, spells, etc. However, it is set in the regions described below, and has a small set of related changes to elements of the lore and mechanics.


==== Continents / Countries ====
  * Aidilon
    * [[Regions:Evedale]]: The darkness of Aidilon calls Evedale home, and evils await within every shadow
    * [[Regions:Istovia]]: The terrain of Istovia is cold, harsh, and rough; just like its people
    * [[Regions:Neeru]]: TODO
    * [[Regions:Qurea]]: The sunny and magical realm of Qurea promises bounty and happiness to all who play its Game
    * [[Regions:Hartland]]: The piney forests beyond Hartland's city walls hide myriad dangers for the unwary adventurer
    * [[Regions:Wrakarr]]: Beware the Gates of Wrakarr: you will never return
  * Ordan
    * [[Regions:Kharsh]]: The sun-laiden plains of Kharsh will test your mettle and decide your worth
    * [[Regions:Ku'nogar]]: A mysterious land to the far east, its secrets shrouded in mist


==== Rule/Lore Changes ====
  * As this campaign setting is used for versions of D&D where the dragonborn race is both common and uncommon, in Dracarcer, they are generally considered rare, but not unheard of; and are about as common as a high level hero of any individual class would be. The origins of dragonborn and draconic sorcerers are opposite sides of the same circumstance: when a male dragon in humanoid form mates with a female humanoid, the subsequent line will be draconic sorcerers; when a female dragon in humanoid form mates with a male humanoid, the subsequent line will be dragonborn.
  * The origins of the various sub-races of Elf are different in Dracarcer than in traditional D&D lore; but their overall mechanics and culture are left largely untouched
