=== Nyokadi ===
{{ nyokadi.jpg?475}}
Nestled on a remote hill, deep in the heart of Istovia's vast expanses, lies the Luminow village of Nyokadi. It is the home of one of Aidilon's last known groups of the ancient race of Light Elves. At one point hunted almost to extinction, the peaceful Luminow now keep to themselves and their ancient traditions; but always have a warm hearth and a kind smile for any who visit their home.
