"As you pass through the intricately carved and masterful stonework housing the portcullis, you see a sprawling city built with no less craftsmanship. To the right, the ornate and delicate-looking wrought-iron fence runs off the gate, along the city’s edge, and into the forest, which appears to have crawled over the man-made boundary and extended itself well into the city proper.
