====== Evedale ======
{{:redwood.jpg?670}}

Few live by choice within the dark, and often ominous, borders of the dominion of Evedale; it is often simply the hand they were dealt by fate. For reasons unknown, greater misfortune seems to fall upon the country's inhabitants than on people elsewhere, and all manner of malice and ill-intent finds itself drawn to Evedale's lands. Perhaps it has something to do with the country's proximity to Wrakarr, or maybe it's just an ongoing sense of dread over the recurring wars with Istovia; but something about Evedale is decidedly... unwelcoming.

The land itself is even inhospitable to its residents: the maleficent Redwood that pervades most of Evedale's forested eastern territories does not take kindly to things traveling within it. The thick, twisting roots of the deep red plants ooze a slick substance poisonous to most creatures; and their branches have a tendency to lash out with little warning, and hostile intent.

==== Notable Places ====

{{:dracwyn.jpg?500}}
{{ :greywald.jpg?395}}
=== Dracwyn ===
The populous capital city of Dracwyn hosts Greywald Hold, home to the royal family of Evedale. Whether known or not, Dracwyn sits almost immediately above the major underdark city of Evaire, whose Drow inhabitants would love nothing more than to establish a foothold on the surface world. The surface city has its own problems, however, as it is often fraught with troubles ranging from run of the mill cereal killers, to feuding political factions, to people being driven mad by waking nightmares...


-------------------------------------


=== Fallwinter ===
{{ :fallwinter.jpg?500}}
Fallwinter is one of the largest cities in Evedale, besides Dracwyn; and the king's right hand, the Count of Fallwinter, resides in the city's castle, governing much of the eastern half of Evedale.


--------------------------------------------------------


=== Haedleigh ===
{{ :haedleigh.jpg?300}}
Dracwyn's nearby sister city of Haedleigh to the southwest has grown in recent years, becoming a large and well-established power in its own right. Commerce there is strong, despite its residents reputation for being obtusely strong-headed, and often quite inhospitable to outsiders. 


=== Lazhani ===
The small hunting village of Lazhani sits just beyond the eastern outskirts of Dracwyn; and despite its position as an optimal trade route between the capital and several other major cities to the east, experienced merchants will often go out of their way to avoid the town, given is unfortunate history of sickness and plague. Because of this, Lazhani relies heavily on support from the Valeyard Keep a few miles to the north for its continued subsistence.


-------------------------------------------


{{ :foxwynne_aldmorrow.jpg?500}}
=== Foxwynne and Aldmorrow ===
The twin cities of Foxwynne and Aldmorrow sit on either side of the river Tels, and are each overseen by their respective Viscounts. As the easternmost cities in the dominion of Evedale, Foxwynne and Aldmorrow are the primary points of trade with the country's Hart and Qurean neighbors, which has blessed the cities with an abundance of wealth and prosperity not often found elsewhere in Uthoukar. However, this time of prosperity lasted only until a feud between the Viscount of Foxwynne and the Viscountess of Aldmorrow over the death of her husband began a civil war in 9935 that destroyed Aldmorrow, and nearly took Foxwynne along with it. 


-------------------------------------------


=== Malaemor ===
{{ :malaemor.jpg?450}}
The drow city of Malaemor was built as a part of the Blackfrost Treaty of 9941. In return for providing Evedale with aid in the war, the Drow were permitted to build a city above the Underdark fracture, in the swamps south of Dracwyn; as well as appointing one of their own as a marquis in the capital city. Evedale's dense forests and even murkier swamps provided enough darkness for the light-sensitive Drow to successfully establish their first true stronghold in the surface world. 


-------------------------------------


=== The Fracture ===
{{ :fracture.jpg?425}}
In 9935, in the swamps south of Dracwyn, a fissure opened up, revealing an entrance to a world previously unknown to surface dwellers: the Underdark. Many species, including the Drow, call this place home, and have built entire civilizations beneath the protection of Dracarcer's solid earth. 


=== Evaire ===
"Before you lies the city of Evaire: built within an expansive cavern, over a mile wide, the city is composed of several layers built atop each other, each resting on what appears to be intricate spiderwebs made of stone. The webs emit a faint glow, and are far enough apart for buildings to have been built between them atop the webs, and sometimes suspended from below. In the center of the webs is a large cylindrical structure that runs from the top of the cavern to the bottom, and through each of the layers. Many of the webs attach at stalactites and stalagmites throughout the cavern, but some parts of some of the webs run all the way to the cavern's outer walls, leading into and out of the city from other parts of the underdark."
