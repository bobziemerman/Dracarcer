====== Hartland ======

{{:uthoukar_forest.jpg?675}}

The noble kingdom of Hartland is in many ways a balancing point within Dracarcer. It is neither the harsh, cold, magicless mountains of Istovia to the north; nor the lush, arcane groves and beaches of Qurea to the south. And it hosts neither the dark, unknowable evils of Evedale to the west, nor the open, unbridled aggression found in plains of Kharsh across the sea to the East. There are many things to be found in Hartland: magics, simple pleasures, common folk, and unexpected adventures. It is often what you expect, and yet can always surprise you.

==== Notable Places ====

{{corwald.jpg}}
=== Corwald ===
Hartland's capital of Corwald can be found 250 miles east of the coast, and sits roughly at the center of the country's territories, near lake Mala'ki, along the Na'is river. The city itself is built atop a gently sloping hill, with the city's sections forming concentric rings that rise toward Castle Longspire at the center. The city sections are as follows:
  * Castle Longspire
    * The seat of power of the Realm of Hartland; from this central location, the King and his court oversee the affairs of the kingdom, and protect its interests.
  * Boroughgrove District
    * Sometimes referred to by non-residents as 'Hightown', the Boroughgrove district is the ideal location for Corwald's well-to-do citizens. Its proximity to the city's libraries and magic shops, as well as to Castle Longspire, make it the only place to be for Corwald's nobles and wealthy elite.
  * Stonewood Lanes
    * These interconnected lanes of housing are home to many of Corwald's permanent residents, and affords them a status of citizenry and protection not afforded to those who stay in the Migrant quarter. Most of the city's temples can also be found within Stonewood.
  * Migrant Quarter
    * The largest and outermost layer of the city sits immediately within the outer walls, and houses the military barracks and common city services like healers and cemeteries; as well as the migrant housing and storefronts required for commerce. In times of economic strain and great danger, the Migrant Quarter bears the burden of the influx of refugees from throughout the kingdom, who remain limited to within its walls.
  * Military Garrisons
    * At the north and south ends of the city, on the outskirts of the Migrant Sector, lie the Military Garrisons. Each serves different purposes, but together they provide for much of the city's military, medical, and internment needs.

=== Kamidryma ===
{{:kamidryma.png?300 }}
Nestled deep within the Fellwood in between its twin rivers of Na'is and Kant, rests an academy of magics known to few. Those in Hartland who wish to master the arcane arts (but who lack the prestige to make their way to one of the schools in Qurea), often find themselves amidst Kamidryma's secluded halls. 

The institution produces some of the finest mages in Hartland; but with no oversight from the kingdom, and little insight into the practices and motivations of the staff, no one's entirely sure what goes on there... or who //doesn't// come out.

=== Mistharbor ===
{{ :mistharbor.jpg?300}}
Along Hartland's eastern coast lies the sleepy fishing village of Mistharbor. Despite being the closest port city to Corwald, the town's permanent residents often only number in the hundreds.


=== The Fellwood ===
'The Fellwood' is the common name given to Hartland's piney forests; particularly those immediately surrounding Corwald. The Fell has been known to harbor bandits, beasts, and all manner of creature poised in waiting for a chance to strike at an unwary traveler. 


=== Jaquence ===
In the southeast of Hartland, nestled in a deep, old wood, is the small village of Jaquence. Rather than trying to clear the enormous trees in this part of the forsest, the residents decided to instead use the trees as natural shelter, building their homes and businesses within the bases of the trees themselves.


=== Linhollow ===
Linhollow is a small hunting village just northeast of Corwald. They have a reputation for being somewhat aggressive, and unfriendly to outsiders.
