====== Istovia ======
{{:istovia.jpg?675}}

The terrain of Istovia is cold, harsh, and rough; just like its people. The environment makes for hardy citizens, but no mortal body was built to withstand the region's bitter cold. In fact, losing entire limbs to frostbite is rather common, and has forced the people of Istovia to innovate in order to thrive. Much of the empire lives underground in stone-hewn cities, connected by the Veins of the Mountain, and the thundercarts that speed hurriedly between them. The inhospitable surface is instead home to the barbaric race of frost giants that rule most of the land above with an icy fist.

Having turned their backs on the vile corruptions of magic, Istovians rely upon their god and upon their gears; and when Hroknar deems a limb unworthy of protection from the bitter cold, the people of Istovia honor him by crafting their own in its place. Intricate clockwork and gears, made with the rare, holy element Valthril, make for a fine replacement for the frail machines of flesh they are given at birth. Most people who have lived in Istovia for more than a handful of years have at least one mechanical limb, and some have shown such dedication to their god that what remains of their original bodies is almost indistinguishable from the iron golems that are so common throughout the empire. And in return, Hroknar blesses these people with a resistance to the magical taint, whenever it should rear its ugly head.

==== The Church of Hroknar ====
{{ :Arsenic_shiny_red.jpg?300 }}

<html><center></html>
**"All must be joined as equal kin in blood, ice, and stone"**
<html></center></html>

Long, long ago, Hroknar carved the land from stone and its people from ice, and he gave them his blood to bring life to their bodies. He hid Valthril, shards of his divine essence, in the depths of the stone to test his children and to provide them with an opportunity to ascend to a higher level of existence. He first spoke to the Istovian Empire in the year 278, and thus began his Church and its Heald here on this plane; the one True Church later copied by all other blasphemers and their false gods.

The God of blood, ice, and stone is a benevolent one, and his followers in Istovia are many. The Church of Hroknar and its Cardinals see to it that no Child of Blood and Stone is left wanting, and spends its bloodstones on taking care of the poorest and most destitute of its flock. The Heald also offer their blessed and wise political council, acting as a guiding hand to the leaders of this great nation, as it brings Hroknar's light to the world beyond.

**In Dwarvish**

“Hroknar, oformyasht blagosloven kamŭk, nie tŭrsim ubezhishte v Tebe.
Rŭkovodstvo na vsichki khora, Bog na vsichki bozhestva, Gospod na vsichki angeli,
Molim vi da razseete mraka na pokvarata ot sŭrtsata na narodite,
I povdignete zhivota im ot vsedostatŭchnata si sila.

Hroknar, molim te da premakhnesh vsichki neshtastiya na sveta:
che razbiraneto triumf nad nevezhestvoto,
che shtedrostta triumfira nad bezrazlichieto,
che doverieto triumfira nad prezrenieto,
i tazi istina triumfira nad lŭzhata.

Hroknar otvori ochi, za da vizhdam nuzhdite na drugite,
I otvori ushite si, za da chuya vikovete im,
Neka ne se strakhuvam da zashtitavam slabite zaradi gneva na silnite,
Nito se strakhuvat da zashtitavat bednite zaradi gneva na bogatite.
Hroknar otvori ochi i ushi,
Za da moga tozi idniya den da moga da izpŭlnya Tvoyata volya.”

<newcolumn>

**In Common**

“Hroknar, shaper of blessed stone, we take refuge in You.
Guide of all people, God of all deities, Lord of all angels,
We pray you to dispel the darkness of corruption from the hearts of nations,
And lift their lives by your all-sufficient power.

Hroknar, we pray to you to eradicate all misery in the world:
that understanding triumph over ignorance,
that generosity triumph over indifference,
that trust triumph over contempt,
and that truth triumph over falsehood.

Hroknar open my eyes that I may see the needs of others,
And open my ears that I may hear their cries,
Let me not be afraid to defend the weak because of the anger of the strong,
Nor afraid to defend the poor because of the anger of the rich.
Hroknar open my eyes and my ears,
That I may this coming day be able to do Thy will.”

{{ :brun_interior.jpg?200}}
=== Brun ===
Istovia's capital city of Brun acts as the beating heart of the empire, and is the epicenter for mechanical innovation and holy writ. It sits atop multiple mountain ranges in Istovia's north, with railway bridges spanning the huge chasms that divide the major city sections. Much of the day to day labor required to keep the city running is carried out by the city's small army of iron and stone golems, leaving the city's inhabitants the time to focus on expanding the country's holdings in the uncivilized parts of Aidilon further south. 


-----------------

{{ valspart.jpg?225}}
=== Valspart ===
Valspart sacellum lies beneath Brun's city peaks, deep within the heart of the mountains. It is the seat of the Heald: the three Archprelates that bear the responsibility of guiding and overseeing the whole of the church of Hroknar. They, in turn, delegate responsibilities to the Church's Prelates, who themselves rely on the Cardinals, Brothers, and Sisters more local to the other regions of Istovia to do His divine work. 

The sacellum is the largest in Istovia's territories, and is almost the size of the city of Brun itself. Huge, cavernous rooms are filled with intricately carved stone statues and bloodstone-encrusted holy relics. The devoted members of the chanter's guild have been singing ceaseless songs of praise to Hroknar for longer than any Istovian has been alive. 

Early on in Istovia's history, the Church began gathering up the sacred bloodstones and housing them in Valspart's vaults. The shards, jewels, and gems of the larger bloodstones became such a sought-after commodity that they eventually came to be used as the primary form of currency in the developing country. Over the years, Valspart has grown to be an important center for commerce, and a hub for major financial transactions.

{{ :nyokadi.jpg?475}}
=== Nyokadi ===
Nestled on a remote hill, deep in the heart of Istovia's vast expanses, lies the Luminow village of Nyokadi. It is the home of one of Aidilon's last known groups of the ancient race of Light Elves. At one point hunted almost to extinction, the peaceful Luminow now keep to themselves and their ancient traditions; but always have a warm hearth and a kind smile for any who visit their home.
