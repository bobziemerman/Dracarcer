====== An artificer's notes on Humans ======

//"You'd think it'd be easier to fabricate my own reconstruction of the most common beings on the continent; but Humans have proven to be... unusual, as a species."//

  * 5/9/3/9984 - As they are the most populous sapient species on the continent, I will be focusing on Humans as the basis of study for my Project
  * 6/9/3/9984 - One possible complication (or avenue of future research?): Humans are unusual on Aidilon in that they are the only species able to produce viable mixed-blood offspring. All known half species are half human, half something else (orc, elf, devil, etc.)
  * 3/1/4/9984 - I was hoping that learning about their origins would prove useful, but I discovered that they have none... at least not on record. Humans are the only member of the five "ancient species" from pre-history (Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, and Halflings) that can't trace their ancestry all the way back to a specific region of the continent. No one knows where they originally came from, but some of the relevant scholars think it may have been the [[:wastelands]] of Wrakarr, many millennia ago. Seems unlikely.
  * 7/1/4/9984 - Humans are less... common than I had hoped; pivoting to other avenues of research
