==== Notable Places ====

=== Corwald ===

{{corwald.jpg?600}}

Uthoukar's capital city of Corwald is built atop a gently sloping hill, with the city's sections forming concentric rings that rise toward Castle Longspire at the center. 

City sections:
  * Migrant Quarter
    * The largest and outermost layer of the city sits just within the walls, and houses the military barracks and common city services like healers and cemeteries; as well as the migrant housing and storefronts required for commerce. In times of economic strain and great danger, the Migrant Quarter bears the burden of the influx of refugees from throughout the kingdom, who are confined to within its walls.
  * Stonewood Lanes
    * These interconnected lanes of housing are home to many of Corwald's permanent residents, and affords them a status of citizenry and protection not afforded to those who stay in the Migrant quarter. Most of the city's temples can also be found within Stonewood.
  * Boroughgrove District
    * Sometimes referred to by non-residents as 'Hightown', the Boroughgrove district is the ideal location for Corwald's well-to-do citizens. Its proximity to the city's libraries and magic shops, as well as to Castle Longspire, make it the only place to be for Corwald's nobles and wealthy elite.
  * Castle Longspire
    * The seat of power of the Realm of Uthoukar rests firmly within the walls of Castle Longspire. From this central location, the King and his court oversee the affairs of the kingdom, and protect its interests.


=== The Fellwood ===

'The Fellwood' is the common name given to Uthoukar's piney forests; particularly those immediately surrounding Corwald. The Fell has been known to harbor bandits, beasts, and all manner of creature poised in waiting for a chance to strike at an unwary traveler. 


=== Mistharbor ===

Along Uthoukar's eastern coast lies the sleepy fishing village of Mistharbor. Despite being the closest port city to Corwald, the town's permanent residents often only number in the hundreds.
