====== Wrakarr ======

{{ wrakarr_gate_temple.jpg?200}}

No mortal has ever emerged from the Gates of Wrakarr.

Nothing is known about the enormous portals the dot the dry, mountainous landscape in the south of Aidilon. They have stood for as long as Men and Mer have been recording history, and were clearly built for something larger than what any living thing has ever encountered. Mages have spent lifetimes studying the devices and come up empty. No scouts have ever returned. From glimpses seen through the openings, the lands beyond, varied as they are, appear to be the domains of gods and giants. Footsteps like thunder, and men driven mad at the faintest sight of great and terrible beings.

Do not breach the gates. 

The You that enters will not return.
